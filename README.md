# LaboratoryNoteHelper
An app for storing notes in Android.

TODO:
  - Generate different notebooks for different types of notes.
  - Make the notes searchable from the Action bar.
  - Different types of notes (plate info, freezer boxes etc).
  - Bulk export results (google drive, evernote with API; may be more complex with images attached, I could possibly send a long list of text however. For Evernote: https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/android_intents.php).
  - Update the UI, its getting a bit crowded. I need to play around and see what works.
